Next, let's look at some more complains.

# System unavailable, freezes up or crashes

Customers and call-center staff complained that the system **"freezes-up"** or worst is not **available**.

Transcript:
Hum.. That's sounds pretty bad and probably adds to the customer frustration of having an issue in the first place.
There is a few reasons for that though, let's break that down.

Characteristics: Reliability, Availability

üìà Customer Usage Spike

Transcript:
Also, the team mentioned customer usage spikes as the route cause of the performance problems. Might be although we don't know as we don't have any evidences.

Characteristics: Elasticity

üìù Reporting

Transcript:
Another piece though that could be the cause of the performance issues is the Reporting. Depending on the kind of reports, this can add a lot of pressure to the system, and especially when resources are shared with other core functionalities like in a monolithic architecture. 

---

üõ† Another problem: system is hard to change

"Whenever a change is made, it takes too long and something else usually breaks"

Transcript: This is probable due to the strong coupling between components that emerged with time from the monolithic system.

Characteristics: Maintainability

____

# Decision
 
Add monitoring

ARDs: 12

Transcript:
Anyway, those are wild guesses. We actually don't know for sure. So the right way to look at those problems should probably be to invest in monitoring and do some proper root cause analysis.

Characteristics: Observability

Although we did not actually stop there and brought also some answers to those problems.

# Solution

Split the monolith

Transcript: divide and conquer strategy will help us to improve code maintainability and address the availability problem     

---

When splitting a monolith there are some architecture style option to pick...

... we decided to go service-based architecture 

Transcript: this is pretty cool, now we can quickly introduce services and we don't even need to split the database. 

---

Before to start splitting the monolith, we need to do a strategic change in the architecture

--- 

# Decision

Add an API layer as single point of contact 
- to provide an abstraction layer 
- and to allow decomposition of the monolith and provide services 

ADRs: ADR2

Transcript: exactly what we need, this will increase flexibility and testability

--- 

how we continue? Which service shold we split first

--- 
# Decision

Segregate reporting into a separate service

- to avoid collateral impact of the resources consumption load that reporting could cause
 

ADRs: ADR4

Transcript: excellent, now load caused by report generation will not impact other functionality.  

---

can decouple more the monolith

Transcript: let see if we found some quick wins

---

# Decision

Improve security by introducing more services
 - by splitting from the monolith the authentication and payment component
 - each in its own service with its own separated database  

Transcript: awesome, now the sensible data is isolated and more secure
